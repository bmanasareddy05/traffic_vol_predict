## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict traffic volume on highways using various weather and temporal features. The dataset includes information such as time of day, day of the week, temperature, rain, snow, and cloud coverage. Multiple regression models are employed, and the best-performing models are identified through cross-validation.
